# strayFw

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nekith/strayFw.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Nekith/strayFw)

The strayFw is yet another PHP framework which is trying to present few things differently.

* Homepage : http://stray.errant-works.com
* Version : beta - 0.1-Leoric

Yes, it's loosely based on MVC architecture. Yes, again. But, again, we try to change a few things.
We don't think it's a revolutionary framework. We just try to do different. Maybe you will like the
way too.

Documentation is somewhere on the homepage. So... read it !

Code is free, new-BSD license. So... fork us !

## Requirements

* Running web server handling PHP
* PHP 5.4.x
* [pecl-yaml](http://pecl.php.net/package/yaml 'pecl-yaml') 1.1.0

## Need help ?

Read the fraktastic manual !

Or add an issue on github ! ;)
