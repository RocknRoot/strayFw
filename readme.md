# strayFw

strayFw is a PHP framework trying to be modern without following fashion, between full-featured frameworks and micro ones.

Code is free, new-BSD license. So... fork us!

### Why? / Why not?

* It's beta software.
* Configuration over convention.
* Use of reflection at runtime as limited as possible.
* Making use of type hinting anywhere possible.
* strayFw follows a small selection of PSR (see below: Development > Technical considerations).
* Contain neither dependency injection nor annotations.
* Data models are defined by a schema in YAML. Migrations are, for the most part, generated by a automated diff between schemas.
* Data models are generated by the CLI ahead of web-server-time/run-time.
* Composer dependencies are minimal.
* DBMS wise, only PostgreSQL is supported.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.4
* mbstring extension
* For the Locale namespace, intl extension >= 1.0.0
* For the [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/ 'Twig') renderer, twig/twig >= 3.0

## Get started
